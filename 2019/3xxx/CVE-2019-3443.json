As we described in an October email, Adobe Flash has a history of security problems and will no longer be supported by Adobe in December of 2020. Over the past year we have done our best to minimize any impact to you. Files with Flash have been removed from systems such as CommunityShare and EmployeeShare Corporate applications have been upgraded eliminating Flash dependencies Our standard endpoint/laptop configurations were reconfigured to prompt you to acknowledge the use of Flash prior to it executing. There remain a few applications that still have flash dependencies in commercial products; as a result, we are pressuring our vendors to upgrade these as fast as possible. These final steps will help us take this vulnerability out of our systems. We have five internal systems remaining that the vendors need to modernize. Vbrick in the MITRE Media Center (MMC) MarkView in Accounts Payable Invoice VMware Administrator Console in ECE Adobe Connect in the MITRE Institute\u2019s training system Oracle Taleo recruiting system Early in the new year we will begin blocking Flash content at our external firewalls. We will have exceptions for needed services, such as the Taleo recruiting system. As these systems convert to better technologies, such as HTML5, we can block Flash completely from our network."
